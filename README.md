# Hardware

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

## IMU

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

A IMU helps to make localization much more stable by providing accelerometer, gyroscope and some even magnetometer data.  
[cartographer](https://github.com/cartographer-project/cartographer) can easily be setup with IMU to improve localization.

- [MPU6050](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MPU-6050/) - IMU sensor combining a MEMS accelerometer and a MEMS gyro on a single chip.

## LIDAR

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

A LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) can create an accurate representation of its surroundings by utilizing a laser and a light sensor to measure TOF (Time of Flight). Devices are available as 2D and 3D variants, although the 3D variants are still pretty expensive and do not add much value to the "robot vacuum" use case.

- [camsense-X1](https://github.com/Vidicon/camsense-X1) - Unofficial reverse engineering of a Chinese LiDAR. `GPL-3.0`
- [RPLIDAR A Series](https://www.slamtec.com/en/Lidar/A1) - 360 Degree Laser Scanner with ROS integration and up to 16K samples per second.

## Frameworks

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

- [Gobot](https://github.com/hybridgroup/gobot/) - Golang framework for robotics, drones, and the Internet of Things (IoT).  `Apache-2.0` `golang`
- [ROS (Robot Operating System)](https://wiki.ros.org/) - Provides libraries and tools to help software developers create robot applications. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. `BSD` `Various`

## SLAM

**[`^        back to top        ^`](#)**

SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) is used to build a map by repeatedly scanning surrounding area and through that enable the robot to localize itself within that environment.
